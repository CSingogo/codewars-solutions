'''
Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a string), return the result of the two numbers having that operator used on them.

a and b will both be positive integers, and a will always be the first number in the operation, and b always the second.

The four operators are "add", "subtract", "divide", "multiply".

A few examples:(Input1, Input2, Input3 --> Output)

5, 2, "add"      --> 7
5, 2, "subtract" --> 3
5, 2, "multiply" --> 10
5, 2, "divide"   --> 2.5

'''

## solution

def arithmetic(a, b, operator):
    if operator == 'add':
        return a + b
    elif operator == 'subtract':
        return a - b
    elif operator == 'multiply':
        return a * b
    elif operator == 'divide':
        return a / b
